# BLENDER-OBJECT-DISPLAY-USING-AR
This project uses an object made in blender to display on aruco marker.

# NEED FOR BLENDER
OpenGL has some predefined models, but if we want to make our own models then it will be a troublesome process.
We can't really manually define all the vertices,normals,and texture coordinates of complicated shapes like houses,vehicles,or human like characters.
We need models that were carefully designed by 3D artists in tools like blender.These 3D modelling allow artists to create complicated shapes and
apply textures to them via a process called uv mapping.The tools then automatically generate all the vertex coordinates,vertex normals,and texture coordinates
while exporting them to a model file format we can use.
